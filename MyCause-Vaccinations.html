            <h2>Myths and facts regarding vaccinations</h2>
            
            <p>Some people believe that vaccines are only for kids and not adults. However, that is false and all adults can and should get vaccinated. Some believe that preventable disease outbreaks don't occur anymore. That is not true, because travelers, who have not been vaccinated, can contract and spread disease. Another myth is that vaccines are not safe. Vaccines are in fact safe, because they undergo extensive testing and monitoring before they are approved. Others think that they cannot control prevention. It is a fact that, timely vaccines protect you from infectious diseases. Those, who are pregnant, do not think that they can get vaccinations. The truth of it is that certain vaccinations, such as the flu and whooping cough shots protect your baby in the utero and after birth. Those were some myths and facts regarding vaccinations.</p>
            
            <!-- reasons to get vaccinated -->
            <h2>Why should you get vaccinated?</h2>
            
            <p>The main reason to get vaccinated is to not cacth a disease or spread a disease. There have been new vaccines over the years to prevent a decent amount of diseases. Some of these diseases are polio, measles, mumps, and more. Those used to be common in this country and around the world. Being abled to preven these diseases have saved lives. Vaccines contain the same antigens (or parts of antigens) that cause diseases. But they are either killed, or weakened to the point that they do not cause disease. However, they are stong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity. The child gest the protection without having to get sick. Immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community. If an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ, the child's body may not be strong enough to fight the disease.</p>

            <h2>What are some effects of NOT getting vaccinated?</h2>
            
            <p>There are many things that can happen if not vaccinated. You can be harming yourself and others. If, you or your child is not vaccinated and one of you becomes ill and has to recieve medical assistance, then you or your child might require uncommon treatment. The medical staff may be less familiar, and less expierenced, withh the procedures required to appropriately treat you or your child. Women who are preganant but not vaccinated can be vulnerable to diseaese that may complicate their pregnancy and their babies may also be affected by it. It could harm others, if you or your children are not vaccinated and get ill. This could occur, if you or your children come in contact with someone with cancer and others with compromised immune systems and they catch whatever you or your children have. These people, those with compromised immune systems, rely on the general public being vaccinated so their risk of exposure is reduced. It could also lead to being quarantined, even family members. If it is a child, then they could mss school and special events. It could also impact the parents' work and household income. Every year the flu season comes around an dis very dangerous. For those who are not vaccinated, it is even more dangerous and sometimes even deadly. Every year a flu vaccine is skipped, you and your child are at risk for the flu and possibly even death. These are some effects of what could happen if, you or your children are not vaccinated.</p>
